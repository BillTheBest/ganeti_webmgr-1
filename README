========================================
Django Muddle Users 
========================================

This app provides management interface for users and groups.  It differs
from the django admin tool in that it integrates directly into the main
user interface. 

This app will eventually use features from Muddle, to enable pluggable
views and templates.

Installation
----------------------------------------

There are several ways to install Muddle Users.

Muddle Users ships a standard distutils setup.py. A classic invocation
to install from setup.py might be::

 $ python setup.py install

You may need to add sudo in order to install to the system Python.

::

 $ sudo python setup.py install

We also have Muddle Users on PyPI, so it can be installed using pip.
(easy_install also works, but we do not recommend easy_install. Just use pip.)

::

 $ pip install django-muddle-users

If you are installing Muddle Users directly into a Django app, and want
to distribute Muddle Users with your app, simply copy the
muddle_users folder into your Django project.

Configuring Your Django Project
----------------------------------------

1) Add "muddle_users" to INSTALLED_APPS
2) Add "muddle_users.urls" to urls.py if you wish to add views
